*Starting my journey with Bangkit Academy*
--
This February, I will start my journey as a Bangkit Machine Learning Student. It would be a fresh start for me after spending four semesters studying from Uni, now I have many options to pick to decide where to study (haha). As i write this, currently I am on my way to finish the basic lectures from Bangkita and those are:
- Basic Software Dev
- Logic Programming
- Basic Git<br>
And the purpose this repo was made is because I am trying to practice my git skills (idk how to say this). So lets writing down what I've been doing this day.<br>
